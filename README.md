# YouTube Fix

Channel avatars and community post photos on YouTube are hosted on the _yt3.ggpht.com_ domain, which is restricted in some countries. On iOS app, this restriction goes beyond channel avatars and impacts the loading of all images, including video previews. This simple tweak switches URLs to the mirrored _yt4.ggpht.com_, fixing loading issues.
